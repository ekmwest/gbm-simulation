        <h1>Geometric Brownian Motion Simulation</h1>

        <h2>Would You Play This Game?</h2>
        <p>You're offered to play a simple game:
        <ol>
            <li>You start with one dollar of wealth.</li>
            <li>You guess heads or tails.</li>
            <li>A coin is flipped.</li>
            <li>If you win, your wealth increases with 50%.</li>
            <li>If you loose, your wealth decreases with 40%.</li>
            <li>Repeat 2-5.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Seems like a favourably game, right? Would you play it?</p>

        <h2>Answer</h2>
        <p>No, you should not play this game.</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>On average, you'll loose.</p>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>An average player will gain 5% wealth for each coin toss: <span class="math">(1.5 + 0.6) / 2 = 1.05</span></p>
        <p>Here's a simulation of 10 000 players making 10 rounds. Vertical axis displays average wealth (log scale)</p>

        <div id="ensembleSimulation" class="graph"></div>

        <p>However, you're not an average player. You're a single player and will, on average, loose 10% wealth for each coin toss: <span class="math">1.5 * 0.6 = 0.9</span></p>
        <p>Here's a simulation of a single player making 10 000 rounds. Vertical axis displays wealth (log scale):</p>

        <div id="timeSimulation" class="graph"></div>

        <h2>What?!</h2>
        <p>The game is non-ergodic. This means that the ensemble average (the averge of many players) is different from the time average (one player over time).</p>
